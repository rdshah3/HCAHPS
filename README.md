# CMS/HCAHPS Hospital Patient Perspective Scores By State - What's Working and What's Not?
The HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey is a national, standardized, publicly reported survey of patients' perspectives of hospital care. The survey provides a way to measure patients' perceptions of their hospital experience at a national level in order to make valid comparisons between states and hospitals. In addition to making comparisons, results provide hospitals the incentive to improve quality of care and increase transparency of hospital quality.

The survey contains 32 questions, spanning aspects of the patients' hospital experience, including communication with nurses and doctors, staff responsiveness, hospital environment conditions, pain management, communication about medicines, discharge information, hospital rating, and hospital recommendations.

I created an app to view results of each question by state (you can access it here). You can begin to see some correlations between the responses, e.g. those patients who "strongly agree" that they understood their care before leaving the hospital and recommending the hospital (see images below). Although this does not identify a causal relationship, there is potential for hospitals to focus on better and more effective patient education regarding their care before they leave the hospital.

And if I had a choice, I'm going to Utah, Nebraska, Louisiana, or Maine the next time I need care. 

(This will also give you a chance to test your knowledge of U.S. geography!)
